People are spending more time browsing the Internet, watching videos on streaming sites, and connecting with others through social networking sites. These online platforms allow people to share their thoughts freely and anonymously, which means that the online communities can become incredibly toxic if not well monitored. With the ever increasing amount of online users and social media platforms, it is becoming increasingly costly to monitor the online space. The data we used was classified by Crowdflower workers into three categories and was compared to our classifier's outputs. The models that we attempted to implement were a Deep Neural Network with a rectified linear unit (DNN) and a linear classifier.
